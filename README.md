# Sign-It-Up


# Project Description:
Developed a machine learning model to detect and recognize sign language gestures from a comprehensive dataset. Implemented computer vision techniques including hand detection and gesture recognition using Mediapipe and OpenCV. Achieved robust performance in real-time prediction of hand gestures, facilitating enhanced communication accessibility. <br>
<h3> Features: <h3/> <h4>Sign language recognition, translation and speech-to-text conversion </h4>

# Technology and Platform used:
1) Machine Learning
2) Computer Vision: Computer vision algorithms to process sign language gestures.
4) Data Preprocessing: Used libraries and frameworks like OpenCV & TensorFlow to preprocess.
